I can't take no days off, I got money I gotta get 
Hit the gas and I take off, pipes be cracklin' when I shift 
It's clear as you can see, got a big bankroll on me
Got a coupe, got power seats three months before release

Your shoe tongue ain't got no C's
All my diamonds cold, on freeze

I know B's and I know C's
Make your bitch fall in love with a G
Now I don't wanna wear no J's
Pointers in the Cartiers on my face
Stackin' up for my future, came up livin' day to day
Should I buy a new watch? I just made a hundred racks today
Gucci my tube socks, I got a different pair for every day
I can't get no sleep, I got some habits I gotta kick
I been drippin' all week, minimum three thousand on my 'fit
When you work for a boss like me, there's lots of advantages
In my wildest dreams, I don't think that I could imagine this

We don't care 'bout the listeners 
I don't know what a nigga told you
But he should've told you I'm killin' him 
I've been draped in Margielas
And I don't need credentials 
If a nigga can't put that shit on 
Gotta get off the premises 
I just came from the crack of the dawn 
'Cause a nigga was strugglin' 
Had to put all my young niggas on
Ain't no jewelry we sharing 
Had to rock the two-tones on the same day
'Cause these niggas been trippin' 
I triple up, pour up my cup and it's all Tussion'
My coupe got nitro and all dustin' 
We smokin' these niggas like kush
Yeah, when we fuck on these hoes, make 'em gush 
Pop out the Bentley Mulsanne, head to Tootsies
I fuck on your ho and she say that's my pussy
I wet paper napkin, I'm wipin' my dick off
This Actavis slushin', my ho drink that Cristal
She wrapped in saran, dressed fresh as she can
'Cause I just been playin' with these bands 
I open my hand, there's nothin' but bands
Now YSL big as Japan 
I had dropped in the Lam', ducked fast as I can
'Cause I was gettin' trailed by a van 
I'm poppin', my mama, my bitch
